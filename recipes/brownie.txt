Ingredients:

200g unsalted butter

200g dark chocolate, chopped

250g granulated sugar

4 large eggs

5g vanilla extract

120g all-purpose flour
30g unsweetened cocoa powder

5g baking powder

3g salt

Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease a baking pan (approximately 9x9 inches) or line it with parchment paper. Set it aside.

In a microwave-safe bowl or a heatproof bowl placed over simmering water, melt the butter and chopped dark chocolate, stirring occasionally until smooth. Set the mixture aside to cool slightly.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.

Pour the melted chocolate mixture into the sugar and eggs mixture, stirring until smooth and well incorporated.

In another bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the chocolate mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

If desired, fold in the optional chopped nuts or chocolate chips to add extra texture and flavor to the brownies.

Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly.

Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Be careful not to overbake to maintain a fudgy texture.

Once baked, remove the brownies from the oven and allow them to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.

Once cooled, cut the brownies into squares or rectangles and serve.
