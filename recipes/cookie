Ingredients:

200g all-purpose flour
150g unsalted butter, softened
150g granulated sugar
150g brown sugar
2 large eggs
5g vanilla extract
5g baking soda
5g salt
200g chocolate chips (milk, dark, or semi-sweet)
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.

In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set this dry ingredient mixture aside.

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until it becomes light and fluffy. You can use a hand mixer or stand mixer for this step.

Add the eggs, one at a time, to the butter and sugar mixture. Beat well after each addition. Then, add the vanilla extract and mix until well combined.

Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients in the large bowl. Mix on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

Fold in the chocolate chips, distributing them evenly throughout the dough.

Scoop rounded tablespoonfuls of the cookie dough and place them onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each cookie to allow for spreading.

Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may appear slightly undercooked, but they will firm up as they cool.

Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheet for 5 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies!
