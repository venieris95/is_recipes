Ingredients

150g rolled oats

100g protein powder (flavor of your choice)

50g almond butter

50g honey or maple syrup

30g chopped nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts, or cashews)

30g dried fruits (e.g., raisins, cranberries, or chopped dates)

30g dark chocolate chips

20g chia seeds

20g flaxseed meal

60ml unsweetened almond milk (or any other milk of your choice)


Optional: 5g vanilla extract, cinnamon, or other spices for flavor


Instructions:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the rolled oats, protein powder, chopped nuts, dried fruits, dark chocolate chips, chia seeds, and flaxseed meal. Stir well to distribute the ingredients evenly.

In a separate microwave-safe bowl or on the stovetop, gently heat the almond butter and honey (or maple syrup) until they become liquid and easy to mix. Add any optional flavorings, such as vanilla extract or spices, if desired.

Pour the almond butter and honey mixture into the dry ingredients. Add the almond milk gradually, mixing well after each addition until the mixture becomes sticky and holds together when pressed.

Line a square baking dish with parchment paper. Transfer the mixture into the dish and press it down firmly and evenly, using the back of a spoon or your hands.

Place the dish in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to allow the bars to firm up.

Once chilled and firm, remove the mixture from the dish by lifting the edges of the parchment paper. Place it on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut it into bars of your desired size.

Individually wrap the bars in parchment paper or store them in an airtight container with layers separated by parchment paper. Store them in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for longer shelf life.
